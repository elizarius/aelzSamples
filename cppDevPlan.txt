C++ development plan
---------------------

00. Demo application, demonstrating possible elementary samples usage:
    - abstract cli class            OK
    - container with handlers,where key is cli option OK
    - cli hanlder includes virtual usage function     OK
    - LOADER, loading into container handlers (f.i. codility handlers)  OK
    - Start codility and update examples step by step                   OK
    
    - demo should print file name, location and short description, what done by function ?

01. Analyze C++11/14 principal differences from previous standard.
    Run examples on C++11/14 new features 

02. Add pcpu appl to demo


03. DB handler to communicate to postgre container:

    - open connection                       Done
    - create  DBConnection class            Done

    - create table from Cpp appl

    - create X relations according to referenced schema (thread_1)
    - add Y records to relations (thread_2)
    - calculate performance (time to add)

    - add cli handler

    - get Y records from DBs (thread_3)
    - calculate performance (time to get)

    - modify Y records in  DBs (thread_4)
    - calculate performance (time to modify)

    - delete Y records from DBs (thread_5)
    - calculate performance (time to delete)

04. ES: Introduce own signal handler in addition to  exit(1). It will catch
signals like "Ctrl-Z, Ctrl-C" and gracefully shut down
process(with "***Finished" message)

05. Implement different type client / server applications as framework, f.i  piped, forked
    - Simple Makefiles tool chain
    - implement socket class as separate folder
    - refactor udsServer to use socket class
    - implement  client  sending structured message to server instead of simple hello
    - implement raw socket
    - look how socket container implement in C++ 11 standard
------------------------------------------

06  See other useful examples in util/test
07  Factory method , including getopt_long as input and ""Handlers"" singleton as storage.
08  Abstact Factory , read and implement useful example
09  Advanced C++ technik , book in trainings/CPPRead  , check and implement several examples

DONE
----
00. Singlethon with mutex, see in C++11 style
