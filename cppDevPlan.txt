C++ development plan
--------------------

1   Implement different type client / server applications as framework, f.i  piped, forked
    - Simple Makefiles tool chain
    - implement socket class as separate folder
    - refactor udsServer to use socket class
    - implement  client  sending structured message to server instead of simple hello
    - implement raw socket
    - look how socket container implement in C++ 11 standard
------------------------------------------

4   Pipe, simple example  look existing C/C++. Read TCP interprocess communication book, as start point
5   Pipe,  implement  with client / server applications
6   Semaphor simple example on C++

7   Thread, simple example  look existing C/C++. Read TCP interprocess communication book, as start point
8   Threading models, read about exisitng , implement something different than posix threads
9   Fork, simple example  look existing C/C++. Read TCP interprocess communication book, as start point
10  Read latest ISO C++ standard , run useful examples", such as threads.mutex impl

11  Singlethon with threads , see and re-implement Baha example
12  See other useful examples in SS_Commutil/test
13  Factory method , including getopt_long as input and ""Handlers"" singleton as storage.
14  Look ""protclient"" Antti's example , as alternative ""getopt_long"
15  Copy SS_EdgeRoutingMgr / SS_EdgeRouitngCommon as example of protomsgs lib implementation,
  find place  where it is implemented on socket as protocol ( 4 bytes , length of message added)

16  Coding style guide , read carefully , check questionable proposals
17. BoostCpp  , read , execute  useful examples
18  Event management framework , read and run examples : sockets etc .
19  Abstact Factory , read and implement useful example
20  Template method , implement to myCpp samples
21  Read available books , execute some examples from them ": ScottMayers, Q&A old course , stl maps etc"
22  Find book : refactoring for old systems  , read and execute examples"
23  Develop StatePattern , because useful for state machine
24  Advanced C++ technik , book in trainings/CPP"Read  , check and implement several examples
25  Apply for open sourced github C++ project
26  Blockmon framework, implemenent several
2   Find useful MFP C examples
3   Find good discussion group, f.e in Linkedin, stackoverflow

DONE
----
0.1 Sort C/C++ into separate folders
0.2 Run unclear C examples from 00_basicC
0.3 Find other C examples, analyse, copy useful to 00_basicC: IP
0.4 Pass through myCpp samples. Implement interested not working, f.i change makefiles
0.5 Go throw old Brain bench tests , implement quiestionable samples
0.6 Install IDE: CodeBlocks

1.1 Implement  udsServer / client appl
