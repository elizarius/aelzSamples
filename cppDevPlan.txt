C++ development plan
--------------------

- Find useful MFP C examples
-----------------------------

- Find good discussion group, f.e in Linkedin, stackoverflow

- Run / analyse existing client server applications
- Implement different type client / server applications as framework, f.i uds, piped, forked

- Pipe, simple example  look existing C/C++. Read TCP interprocess communication book, as start point
- Pipe,  implement  with client / server applications
- Semaphor simple example on C++

- Thread, simple example  look existing C/C++. Read TCP interprocess communication book, as start point
- Threading models, read about exisitng , implement something different than posix threads
- Fork, simple example  look existing C/C++. Read TCP interprocess communication book, as start point
- Read latest ISO C++ standard , run useful examples", such as threads.mutex impl

- Singlethon with threads , see and re-implement Baha example
- See other useful examples in SS_Commutil/test
- Factory method , including getopt_long as input and ""Handlers"" singleton as storage.
- Look ""protclient"" Antti's example , as alternative ""getopt_long"
- Copy SS_EdgeRoutingMgr / SS_EdgeRouitngCommon as example of protomsgs lib implementation,
  find place  where it is implemented on socket as protocol ( 4 bytes , length of message added )
- Coding style guide , read carefully , check questionable proposals
- BoostCpp  , read , execute  useful examples
- Event management framework , read and run examples : sockets etc .
- Abstact Factory , read and implement useful example
- Template method , implement to myCpp samples
- Read available books , execute some examples from them ": ScottMayers, Q&A old course , stl maps etc"
- Find book : refactoring for old systems  , read and execute examples"
- Develop StatePattern , because useful for state machine
- Advanced C++ technik , book in trainings/CPP"Read  , check and implement several examples
- Apply for open sourced github C++ project

DONE
----
- Sort C/C++ into separate folders
- Run unclear C examples from 00_basicC
- Find other C examples, analyse, copy useful to 00_basicC: IP
- Pass through myCpp samples. Implement interested not working, f.i change makefiles
- Go throw old Brain bench tests , implement quiestionable samples
- Install IDE
